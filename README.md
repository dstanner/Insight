Building cocktailVision.

CocktailVision is an app that uses computer vision to turn pictures of your home liquor collection into cocktail recipes. The goal is to find great uses for obscure bottles you might have laying around, as well as save money.

The app is currently hosted at [cocktailvision.xyz](cocktailvision.xyz).

This project was built during a fellowship at Insight Data Science in Fall 2018.
